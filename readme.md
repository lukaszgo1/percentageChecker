This add-on allows you to check how far - in percents - you are in the text or on a list. This information can be given either by spoken message, or by a beep.
In addition you can jump to the given percentage or a line number in the text.

## Key Commands: ##

*	Shift+NVDA+j: Displays a dialog allowing you to jump to the given line number.
*	Shift+NVDA+p: Announces percentage in the current text or on a list. In addition if you are in a text the amount of words in the  field would  be spoken. In case of a list this would be amount of all list items.
*	Alt+NVDA+p:  Presents  your position in a text or on a list as a beep.

The two last commands can be pressed twice in quick succession to display a dialog allowing you to jump to a given percentage in a text.
All these commands can be remapped from the input gestures dialog.
